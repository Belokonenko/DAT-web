        <!-- Description -->
        <!-- Reviews -->
        <!-- General in the Field -->
        <!-- General in the Field. Pre-emergence herbicide for controlling annual broadleaf and some grass weeds in canola and other crops. -->
        <!-- Active Ingredient: Clomazone, 480 g/L -->
        <!-- Formulation: Emulsifiable concentrate -->
        <!-- Usage Rate: 0.2-0.6 L/ha -->
        <!-- Toxicity Class: 2 -->
        <!-- Shelf Life: 2 years -->

        <!-- Characteristics: -->

        <!-- Systemic preparation enters the plant through the hypocotyl and root system, moving through the xylem to the leaves; -->
        <!-- By penetrating the plant, it stops the formation of chlorophyll and carotene, thus halting the photosynthesis process; -->
        <!-- Destroys weeds and creates conditions for good growth and development of winter canola in the autumn period, eliminating competition for light, moisture, and nutrients at the earliest stages of organogenesis; -->
        <!-- Well-bound in soil and minimally leachable; -->
        <!-- Commonly used for comprehensive protection of canola in tank mixes with the active ingredients metazachlor and propizochlor; -->
        <!-- In Eastern European countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland), the use of Command® on canola crops is an essential element in the cultivation technology; -->
        <!-- Widely used in more than 100 countries worldwide on crops such as canola, soybeans, tobacco, peppers, carrots, potatoes, melons, cotton, and other crops. -->
        <!-- Recommendations: -->

        <!-- For maximum effect, quality soil preparation is required: no clods, a leveled field surface, and no plant residues; -->
        <!-- Soil spraying should be carried out within two days, preferably immediately after sowing; -->
        <!-- In case of insufficient soil moisture after spraying, it is recommended to roll the soil with ring-spiked rollers; -->
        <!-- The application rate depends on the humus content in the soil; it can be slightly reduced on low-humus soils; -->
        <!-- Whitening of the first pair of canola leaves may occur, but this will disappear over time, and plants will have a more developed root system and better withstand low temperatures; -->
        <!-- If re-sowing is necessary, canola and soybeans can be sown 30-60 days after treatment after shallow tillage to a depth of 8-10 cm; for all other crops, deep plowing is recommended; -->
        <!-- Ensuring complete coverage of the field surface is a mandatory requirement when applying the preparation. -->
